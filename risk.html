									<h3 class="major">Rank Restricted</h3>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/amumu.jpg" alt="" /></span>The GroupBuy model I'm suggested derived aformentioned model that Steam has been using for years. Thus far, Steam has been highly sucessful at being able to sell niche games and also garner massive interest for less popular games using the GroupBuy Model.
										However, a byproduct of the GroupBuying was that consumers would join random people on forums, purchase the games and never talk to each other again. Even despite owning the same multiplayer games. It became just another game on a Steam Sale and like many of those games, were left largely unplayed or unfinished.
									</p>


									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/restrict.jpg" alt="" /></span>Where Steam saw a problem in the system that cost them money and din't change much, I see a soluion. I see opportunity. League of Legends has a unique platform of a team-based game. How could we leverage that to counteract possible abuse of GroupBuy in a way that promotes Riot Games' core philosophies?
										By restricting GroupBuy purchases to players on ranked teams that have finished placements, we encourage several positive things.
									</p>

													<h3 class="major">Develops Connections</h3>
													<p>Players are encouraged to grow and develop their friends lists. If I only have 4 people to buy a skin, I could talk to random person in any game and see if their interested. I have not only made a new connection but developed it over the course of at least 5 games. It could mean getting out of ones comfort zone. It could mean creating a ranked team between a challenger and an unranked. It's aim is to give players a low pressure way to make more friends in League of Legends instead of enemies. It's an initiative disruptive enough to change the whole community and its perceptions from the inside out. </p>
												</p>

													<h3 class="major">Eases Casual Players into Team Ranked</h3>
													<p>Casual players are given a low-pressure reason to get into team ranked. Team Ranked scares off many new players as a be all and end all judge of skill. However, GroupBuy offers a more casual incentive to atleast try. Players would be rewarded for simply finishing placements. No more incentive for being bronze or for being challenger. It gives casual players a fun way to get into team ranked without disturbing the high caliber play at the top. Who knows, it might bring out team passion that players would have never otherwise knew they had. </p>
												</p>

													<h3 class="major">Fostering Competitiveness</h3>
													<p>Casual and hardcore players alike are encouraged to play on ranked teams developing talent and strengthening the transition to esports. Highly skilled players have an incentive to come back. With more casual players doing getting into ranked, good teams can fly through placements faster. </p>
